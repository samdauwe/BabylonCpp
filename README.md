# BabylonCpp - A port of Babylon.js to C++

<img src="./assets/images/BabylonJSLogo.png" alt="" height="32px"> [Babylon.js](http://www.babylonjs.com) is a complete JavaScript framework for building 3D games with HTML 5 and WebGL. BabylonJS was chosen because it is the most efficient, most feature-rich, and most modern WebGL graphics library available.

The goal of BabylonCpp is to fully implement the relevant portions of the excellent Babylon.js 3D framework/engine in C++17, facilitating the creation of lightweight, cross-platform 3D games and applications with native performance.

It includes more than 200 examples, a graphical inspector for all 3D objects (based on [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)), as well as an interactive playground for live coding and experiments.

# Get the Sources

This repository contains submodules for some of the external dependencies, so when doing a fresh clone you need to clone recursively:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/samdauwe/BabylonCpp.git
```

Existing repositories can be updated manually:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

# Build BabylonCpp from Source

A build script named `cmake_build.py` is provided for compiling all sources from command line on Linux and Windows:

Release build:

```
python cmake_build.py all --mode=release
```

Debug build:

```
python cmake_build.py all --mode=debug
```

A Visual Studio solution file can be generated by using the provided `cmake_build.py` script:

```
python cmake_build.py configure
```

If you're using a different IDE or compiler you can use the provided CMakeLists.txt for use with [CMake](https://cmake.org) to generate a build configuration for your toolchain.

# Sample code

The following code initializes a basic scene by creating a camera, a light, and two basic meshes (a sphere and a ground plane).

```c++

void initializeScene(ICanvas* canvas, Scene* scene)
{
  // Create a FreeCamera, and set its position to (x:0, y:5, z:-10)
  auto camera = FreeCamera::New("camera1", Vector3(0, 5, -10), scene);

  // Target the camera to the scene origin
  camera->setTarget(Vector3::Zero());

  // Attach the camera to the canvas
  camera->attachControl(canvas, true);

  // Create a basic light, aiming 0,1,0 - meaning, to the sky
  auto light = HemisphericLight::New("light1", Vector3(0, 1, 0), scene);

  // Default intensity is 1. Let's dim the light a small amount
  light->intensity = 0.7f;

  // Create a built-in "sphere" shape; its constructor takes 4 params: name,
  // subdivs, size, scene
  auto sphere = Mesh::CreateSphere("sphere1", 32, 2.f, scene);

  // Move the sphere upward 1/2 of its height
  sphere->position().y = 1.f;

  // Create a built-in "ground" shape.
  // Params: name, width, depth, subdivs, scene
  Mesh::CreateGround("ground1", 6, 6, 2, scene);
}

```

This code results in the following scene:

# Examples
Example scenes can be found on the [samples](https://github.com/samdauwe/BabylonCpp/tree/master/src/Samples) page.

# Status
The master branch code is in sync with the last [Babylon.js v4.1.0](https://doc.babylonjs.com/whats-new) release of 2020/02/27.

The [example scenes](https://github.com/samdauwe/BabylonCpp/tree/master/src/Samples) give a good overview which features are currenlty ported and working for [Babylon.js 4.0.0](https://doc.babylonjs.com/whats-new).

Known issues are summarized [here](https://github.com/samdauwe/BabylonCpp/issues).

A summary of the development roadmap can be found on [this page](https://github.com/samdauwe/BabylonCpp/wiki/Roadmap).
